### dataAnalysis.ipynb
This notebook has initial data anlaysis steps, and data curation steps where the multiple input datasets are merged into a single dataset having relevant features from all the important input files 

### modeling.ipynb
This notebook needs to run after the dataAnalysis.ipynb notebook has been executed. This notebook works on top of datasets created by the dataAnalysis notebook, and performs feature engineering and dataset curation necessary for running the classification algorithms. The machine learning models created as part of the dataset can be tested using updated input datasets.
